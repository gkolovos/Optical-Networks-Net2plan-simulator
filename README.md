# optical-networks

The purpose of the project is to introduce students to the use of the Net2Plan simulator, a
optical network modeling and design tool. Net2Plan has two tools: 
i) Offline network design modeling network topology (nodes, links, paths,protection and traffic requests) and 
ii) Traffic matrix design implementing traffic models.

Download the latest version of the simulator from here:
https://github.com/girtel/Net2Plan/releases. The program is implemented in Java and does not
requires some special installation. Just unzip the .zip file and run the file
Net2Plan.jar. The system requires Java 7 (or higher). Read the user guide
from here: http://www.net2plan.com/documentation/current/help/usersGuide.pdf, especially Chapters
1, 2 and 3 (bypassing section 3.4).

Part One:
Step 1: Implement Network Topology and Add Network Traffic.
From the menu, select Offline network design and implement the network below. All the
links must be bidirectional.
